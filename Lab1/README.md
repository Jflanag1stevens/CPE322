Half Adder Example

![](./HalfAdderExample.png)

This is a simulation of a half adder. Signals a and b are the inputs, s and c are the outputs. We can see that when only a or b is 1, s is 1 and c is 0. When a and b are both 0, s and c are also both 0. When a and b are both 1, then s is 0 and c is 1.
