Node.js

  ![](helloworldjs.png)

  The first file I ran was hello-world.js, it runs a webpage that displays "Hello, World!" 
  
  ![](hellojs.png)

  The next file I ran was hello.js, it runs a webpage that displays "Hello World!"
  Whenever the page is opened or refreshed the terminal in which the pare is running on sends 
  
  "response end call done"
  
  "response end event fired"
  
  ![](httpsjs.png)

  The last node.js file I ran, https.js, runs a webpage that displays "This page was refreshed X times!" where X is the number of times the page was refreshed. In the terminal, each time the page is refreshed the terminal outputs the number of times the page has been refreshed - 1

  After installing pystache I ran the example code from Lesson 6
  ```
  cd ~/iot/lesson6
  cat say_hello.mustache
  cat say_hello.py
  python say_hello.py
  ```
  The results of this code can be seen above
